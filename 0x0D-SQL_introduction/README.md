What is  SQL

Structured Query Language : 

Basic SQL Statemets: DDL and DML:
SQL Statements are divided into two major categories: data definition language(DDL) and Data Manipulation Language(DML).

DDL statements are used to build and modify the structure of the tables and other objects in the database. The CREATE TABLE statement does that exactly. 

DML statements are used to work with the date in the tables.  When you are connected to most Multi-User databases, you are in effect working with a private copy of your tables that can't be seen by anyone else until you are finished.
