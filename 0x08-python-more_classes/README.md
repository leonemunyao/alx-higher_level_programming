Python more Classes and objects.

Obect Oriented Programming:

This is a way of combining data and functionality and wrap it inside something called object. Classes and objects are the main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. 

Objects can store data using ordinary varibles that belong to the object. Variables that belong to an object or class are called fields. Functions that belong to a class are called methods of the class. 

Fields are of two types - they can belong to each instance/object of a class or they can belong to the class itself. The class is created using the class keyword. The fields and methods of the class are listed in an indented block. 

The self:

Classs methods have only one specific difference from ordinary functions - they must have an extra first name that has to be added to the beginning of the parameter list. The given name is self.

Classes

We create a new class using the class statement and the name of the class. This is followed by an intended block of statements which form the body of the class. An empty block is indicated using the pass statements. Next we create object/instant of this class followed by a pair of paranthesis.
